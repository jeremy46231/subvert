# subvert: clickjacking toolkit

Subvert is a toolkit for different kinds of clickjacking, including a library for iframe-based attacks and a set of extensible demos showcasing both the library and more modern double-clickjacking attacks.

The library is in [`library/`](library/README.md) and you can see the demos at [subvert.jer.app](https://subvert.jer.app). To run the demos locally, run `bunx vite` (or however else you run vite, like `npx vite`).
